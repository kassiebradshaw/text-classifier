## Overview

A key developer skill is the ability to use internet resources effectively. Especially when learning a new topic.

For this lab you’ll be converting an excellent tutorial from a couple years ago. Does it still work? Let’s find out!

**NOTE**: You don’t have to understand all of the code in the tutorial yet. Get it working first, in the process it will become more familiar.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

* Your task is to create a baseline classification model by following (and modifying when needed) the Practical Text Classification With Python and Keras tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.
  * To accomplish your primary task you’ll need install several libraries and external assets.

* A big part of this lab is building resilience when faced with an incomplete solution.
* Because most of the time that’s what internet is going to give you.

---

## Implementation Notes

* You are only required to build the Baseline Model.
* Your project will require several dependencies to be installed. Figure out which ones.
* Your project will require downloading external assets to particular locations, and with particular names.
* Some example code may cause errors. Troubleshoot the errors and see if you can fix them.
  * **Hint** - you can

## Setup

* Create a text-classifier repository on GitHub
* Name notebook text_classifier.ipynb

---

## Configuration

* Use poetry to initialize text-classifier project.

```Python
> $ cd text-classifier
> $ poetry init -n
```

---

## Testing

* No automated testing requirements for this lab.
  * Refer to Lab Submission Instructions for detailed instructions.

---

## Stretch Goals

* Complete the full tutorial using Keras
* Summarize in your own words what each code cell is doing.
* Choose another dataset to classify.
* See if you can “fiddle with the knobs” and get a higher accuracy rate from baseline model.
